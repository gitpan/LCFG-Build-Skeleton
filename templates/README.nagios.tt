Put your LCFG nagios Perl helper modules into this directory and name
them with either a '.pm' suffix (and with or without a .cin suffix
beyond that). To clarify, both of these are ok:

foo.pm
bar.pm.cin

They will be installed into the correct location, the same as normal
Perl modules.

As usual, any '.cin' suffix will be stripped off the filename as part
of the build-time template completion process.
